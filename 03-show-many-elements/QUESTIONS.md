# DOM Atomic 03: Show Many Elements

> How did you go about hiding elements initially?

I initally hid the elements with "style display='none'" and found that my elements would not appear even though I had set my Javascript to display the elements with the class name hide_me with the block style when the button is clicked. A quick Google search led me to find that "display: none" is used for Javascript, which fixed my problem.
